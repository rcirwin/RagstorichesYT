## Voice-Over Pacing
- **Target**: 150 words per minute
- **1 minute scene** = ~150 words minimum
- **2 minute scene** = ~300 words minimum
- Include timing markers in voice-over scripts

## Workflow
1. Start with channel guidelines for consistency
2. Use episode template for new episodes
3. Develop outline → script → voice-over sequence
4. Review against brand guidelines before finalizing
5. Export voice-over script for video editor

## File Naming Convention
- Episodes: `EP[3-digit-number]-[descriptive-title]`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for folder names
- Use descriptive filenames within episode folders
