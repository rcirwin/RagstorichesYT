00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The fancy gyms had eucalyptus towels. Jordan Blake had a condemned auto bay that smelled like rubber and chance.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you're tired of glossy fitness fairy tales, this is the story of grit, equity, and an exit no one saw coming.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
By the end of this video, you’ll see how an ex-athlete recruited elite coaches with real upside, turned a drafty garage into a membership machine, and sold to a boutique chain without selling his soul.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Jordan didn’t want to be the strongest guy in the room. He wanted to build the room.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
At thirty-three, he’d managed facilities, coached part-time, and watched talent burn out for lack of ownership.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The landlord of a shuttered auto shop made him an offer: a tenant improvement credit if he signed a seven-year lease and solved the neighbor complaints about noise.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
“Authentic beats pretty,” Jordan told Renee, the coach everyone tried to poach. “I’ll pay market, but the upside is equity if your book grows and stays.”

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Not stock—phantom equity and a retention bonus pool. Upside without losing control.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Buildout was war by a thousand checklists: permits, sound mitigation, fire code, equipment leases, and the kind of rubber flooring the neighbors couldn’t hear.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Classes launched packed, then dipped. Cohort analysis drew a painful picture: new members churned at day ninety.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fix wasn’t discounts. It was an on-ramp, accountability pods, and visible progression.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then came the gut punch. A top coach threatened to leave over comp confusion.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Jordan and Marcus, the fractional CFO, opened the books: how phantom shares paid at milestones, how the retention pool grew with profit, how members per class tied to bonus tiers.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The walkout became a workshop. Trust returned.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Corporate wellness changed everything. Clara from a local tech firm needed lunchtime classes and a quarterly fitness challenge.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That contract filled dead daytime slots at high margin and brought referral waves on weekends.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Utilization climbed to the 70–80% window that makes math sing.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Two years in, IronYard Strength had five hundred fifty members, four corporate contracts, and a reputation for turning average folks into athletes who showed up for each other.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The boutique chain that bought them didn’t just want floors and racks. They wanted the cap table, the cohort playbook, and the culture.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The deal: $2.2 million—cash at close and a two-year earnout tied to membership targets—with an 8% trainer retention bonus pool.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Brand intact. Coaches promoted. Playbook licensed.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here’s what actually mattered. Equity design aligned trainers without giving away the company.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Cohorts revealed the leak you can’t see with vanity membership counts.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Utilization, not hype, paid the bills. And culture was built on transparency before trouble—not apologies after.

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
