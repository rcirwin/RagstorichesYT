## Scene 1: Rubber and Chance — Morning
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Gritty garage tour; lease with TI credit

Jordan Blake didn’t want eucalyptus towels. He wanted a room where work echoed. The landlord offered a tenant improvement credit if Jordan signed a seven‑year lease and solved the neighbor complaints about noise.

“Authentic beats pretty,” Jordan told Renee. “I’ll pay market, but your upside is equity tied to the book you build and keep.” Not stock—phantom equity and a retention bonus pool. Upside without losing control.

## Scene 2: Build the Room — Evening
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Recruiting coaches; culture contract

Renee wasn’t sold on slogans. She wanted numbers. Marcus, the fractional CFO, sketched a cap‑table on a whiteboard: phantom units vesting with retention and member outcomes; bonus pool grows with profit; no surprises at tax time.

“Own the results you create,” Jordan said. “And see them in the books.”

## Scene 3: Permits, Neighbors, and Rubber — Weeks 1–8
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Buildout slog; equipment; compliance

Sound mitigation. Fire code. Equipment leases. Rubber flooring thick enough the neighbors couldn’t hear a deadlift. The first classes launched hot. Then dipped. Jordan didn’t panic. He pulled cohorts.

## Scene 4: The 90‑Day Leak — Month 3
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Cohort analysis; on‑ramp and progression

Spreadsheets told a simple truth: new members churned at day ninety. The fix wasn’t discounts. It was an on‑ramp, accountability pods of six, and visible progression badges that moved people from “Green” to “Iron.” Coaches earned more for progression, not just attendance.

Retention ticked up. Classes refilled. The culture stopped depending on hype and started depending on habits.

## Scene 5: The Walkout That Became a Workshop — Month 6
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Comp confusion; transparent books

A top coach threatened to leave with two dozen members. Jordan and Marcus opened the books: exactly how phantom equity would pay at milestones; how the retention pool grew with profit; how members per class tied to bonus tiers.

The walkout became a workshop. Trust returned because math replaced rumors.

---

## Scene 6: Daytime Money — Month 8
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Corporate wellness; utilization lift

Clara at a local tech firm needed lunch classes and a quarterly challenge. The contract filled dead daytime slots at high margin. Referrals spilled into evenings. Utilization climbed to the 70–80% window where math sings.

---

## Scene 7: The Offer — Year 2
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Exit terms; brand protection

IronYard Strength hit $1.2M ARR: 550 members, four corporate contracts, eighteen staff. A boutique chain offered $2.2M—70% cash, 30% earnout tied to membership targets—plus an 8% trainer retention bonus pool.

“Brand intact. Coaches promoted. Playbook licensed,” Renee said, reading the term sheet.

## Scene 8: Why It Worked — Closing
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Lessons and operating cadence

Equity design aligned coaches without giving away the company. Cohorts revealed the leak vanity metrics hid. Utilization—not hype—paid the bills. Culture came from transparency before trouble, not apologies after.
