# Garage Gym to Million-Dollar Exit - Full Script

The fancy gyms had eucalyptus towels. Jordan Blake had a condemned auto bay that smelled like rubber and chance. If you're tired of glossy fitness fairy tales, this is the story of grit, equity, and an exit no one saw coming.

By the end of this video, you’ll see how an ex-athlete recruited elite coaches with real upside, turned a drafty garage into a membership machine, and sold to a boutique chain without selling his soul.

Jordan didn’t want to be the strongest guy in the room. He wanted to build the room. At thirty-three, he’d managed facilities, coached part-time, and watched talent burn out for lack of ownership. The landlord of a shuttered auto shop made him an offer: a tenant improvement credit if he signed a seven-year lease and solved the neighbor complaints about noise.

“Authentic beats pretty,” Jordan told Renee, the coach everyone tried to poach. “I’ll pay market, but the upside is equity if your book grows and stays.” Not stock—phantom equity and a retention bonus pool. Upside without losing control.

Buildout was war by a thousand checklists: permits, sound mitigation, fire code, equipment leases, and the kind of rubber flooring the neighbors couldn’t hear. Classes launched packed, then dipped. Cohort analysis drew a painful picture: new members churned at day ninety. The fix wasn’t discounts. It was an on-ramp, accountability pods, and visible progression.

Then came the gut punch. A top coach threatened to leave over comp confusion. Jordan and Marcus, the fractional CFO, sat with the team and opened the books: how phantom shares paid out at milestones, how the retention pool grew with profit, how members per class tied to bonus tiers. The walkout became a workshop. Trust returned.

Corporate wellness changed everything. Clara from a local tech firm needed lunchtime classes and a quarterly fitness challenge. That contract filled dead daytime slots at high margin and brought referral waves on weekends. Utilization climbed to the 70–80% window that makes math sing.

Two years in, IronYard Strength had five hundred fifty members, four corporate contracts, and a reputation for turning average folks into athletes who showed up for each other. The boutique chain that bought them didn’t just want floors and racks. They wanted the cap table, the cohort playbook, and the culture.

The deal: $2.2 million—cash at close and a two-year earnout tied to membership targets—with an 8% trainer retention bonus pool. Brand intact. Coaches promoted. Playbook licensed.

Here’s what actually mattered. Equity design aligned trainers without giving away the company. Cohorts revealed the leak you can’t see with vanity membership counts. Utilization, not hype, paid the bills. And culture was built on transparency before trouble—not apologies after.
