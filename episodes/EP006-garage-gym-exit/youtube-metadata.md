## Video Title
Garage Gym to Million-Dollar Exit (Equity for Coaches, Corporate Deals, Clean Exit)

## Video Description
A condemned auto bay. No eucalyptus towels. Just rubber, chalk, and a plan.

Jordan Blake turned a gritty garage into a membership machine by giving coaches real upside, fixing churn with cohort analysis, and filling dead daytime slots with corporate wellness. Then he sold—without selling his soul.

What you’ll learn:
✅ Phantom equity and retention pools for coaches (without losing control)
✅ Cohort analysis that kills 90-day churn
✅ Utilization math: 70–80% is where the margins live
✅ Why corporate contracts lift ARPU without crushing your coaches
✅ How to negotiate an exit that protects your brand and team
