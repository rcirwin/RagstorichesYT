## Scene 1: Letter at Sunrise — Dawn
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Foreclosure notice; decision point

Emma opened the letter in boots still wet from the fields. Sixty days. She folded it under a chipped mug and looked at the tractor that wouldn’t start without a prayer. If the bank wanted a plan, she’d give them a story—and the math to match.

## Scene 2: The Diner Bridge — Midday
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Seller financing structure; broken assets

Sam’s diner had a loyal breakfast crowd and a grill that died every other Saturday. Vendor debt stacked like plates. They built a bridge: $60K down; $240K seller note at 6% over seven years; six months interest‑only to fix leaks without drowning.

## Scene 3: Due Diligence in Grease — Week 1
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Health code; equipment life; vendor arrears

Walk‑in temp logs lied. Health code violations were fixable but not free. Vendor arrears turned into payment plans. The repair quote for the grill made Emma laugh and then almost cry. She signed anyway, then cut the menu in half.

## Scene 4: Chalkboard Truth — Month 1
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Co‑op supply; waste tracking; menu engineering

The chalkboard told the truth: what’s in season, what’s from down the road, what might sell out. Lydia at the co‑op locked in predictable supply. Waste tracking started in a spreadsheet and ended in new habits: batch prep smart, portion honest, cross‑train.

Locals grumbled about price changes. The coffee stayed bottomless. So did her resolve.

## Scene 5: Crisis Weekend — Month 2
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Grill failure; bank pressure; pop‑up fix

The grill died on a Saturday. The bank called Monday to “check progress.” Emma rolled dough at 4 a.m. and ran a Sunday bakery pop‑up that paid for the new burner.

---

## Scene 6: Community Night — Month 3
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Farmers’ dinner; local press; critic visit

The farmers’ dinner sold out on a rainy Thursday. The local paper ran a human story about a widow trying to save her farm by feeding her town well. Grant Wallace sat at the counter, ordered apple tart, and asked about the flour.

---

## Scene 7: Award Season — Year 1
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Regional award; lines; prime cost improvement

He wrote a line that did more than any ad: “This isn’t a theme. It’s a family paying their mortgage with our breakfast.” Lines formed. Not influencer lines. Neighbor lines. Prime costs fell to 62% as the menu learned its own math.

---

## Scene 8: Mortgage Paid — Year 2
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Payoff; staff profit share; permanence

Orchard Mile Diner ran at a $720K pace. The staff shared a profit slice after the note payment. Emma paid the bank, extended the co‑op contract, and wrote the first check that felt like a future.

## Lessons and CTA — Closing
**Duration**: 1 minute

In distress, seller financing buys time—but only if you cut leakage fast. Menu engineering is labor minutes and plate margins, not buzzwords. Supply partners make stories real. Awards just make them loud. If you’re holding a tough letter, remember: banks take checks. Communities take care of their own when you give them something honest to gather around.
