## Video Title
Farm-to-Table Redemption (Seller Financing Saves the Farm)

## Video Description
A foreclosure letter. A bankrupt diner. A town that still believes good food can fix hard problems.

Emma Torres buys a failing roadside diner with seller financing, partners with local farmers, wins a regional food award, and pays off the farm mortgage that started it all.

What you’ll learn:
✅ How seller financing creates time in distressed deals
✅ Menu engineering that improves prime costs without gimmicks
✅ Co-op supply partnerships that add margin and a real story
✅ Press strategy: community night → local paper → regional award
✅ Profit share that keeps staff through the turnaround
