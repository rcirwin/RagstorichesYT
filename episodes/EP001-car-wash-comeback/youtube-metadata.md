How a Delivery Driver Bought an $80K Car Wash with BAD CREDIT (Seller Financing Success Story)

## Video Description
Most people think you need perfect credit and a pile of cash to buy a business. This delivery driver proved them all wrong with just $80,000 and a handshake deal that banks wouldn't touch.

Marcus Rodriguez was trapped in the "hourly prison" - working 12-hour days across three delivery apps just to make $3,200 a month. With a 580 credit score and medical debt, banks laughed at his loan applications. But when he discovered a failing car wash with seller financing available, everything changed.

In this episode, you'll discover:
âœ… How seller financing works when banks say no
âœ… The due diligence secrets that reveal hidden business value  
âœ… How Marcus turned $80K into $8,200/month passive income
âœ… The automation strategies that let him work 2-3 hours per day
âœ… Why bad credit doesn't disqualify you from business ownership

This is the story of how one delivery driver refused to accept financial limitations and built a business empire starting with a handshake deal.
