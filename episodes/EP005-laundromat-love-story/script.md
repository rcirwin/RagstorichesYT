## Scene 1: The Promise and the Price — Evening
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Wedding fund debate, hope vs. risk

[VISUAL: Small apartment kitchen. A jar labeled “Wedding.” Phone open to a laundromat listing.]
[GRAPHIC: “$42,000 Wedding Fund” → “Down Payment + Repairs”]

Maya Alvarez believed in building a life, not just a day. She ran hotel operations like a quiet orchestra—schedules, supplies, smiles at the front desk. Luis believed in fixing things he could hold. They didn’t want a fancy venue. They wanted freedom.

The listing seemed simple: FreshSpin Laundry, busy street corner, nineteen parking spots. “Machines are dated but fine,” said the owner, Eddie. Seller financing available. It sounded like fate. It wasn’t. It was a test.

That night the jar on the table became a compass. Spend on a party once, or spend on a business that could pay for a hundred parties later? Maya sketched the math. Luis squared his jaw. “If we do this, we do it together.”

[TRANSITION: The jar empties into a bank envelope. A door flips from CLOSED to OPEN.]

## Scene 2: Due Diligence Like a Crime Scene — Weekend/Night
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Utility histories, meter checks, coin integrity

[VISUAL: Maya with a clipboard. Luis with a flashlight behind machines.]
[GRAPHIC: Utility chart with late‑night gas spikes circled in red.]

They pulled utility histories and circled the odd spikes after midnight. Doors locked, meters running. Someone was doing free loads. Luis popped coin doors: one machine paid out without counting. Bearings screamed when the drum hit spin. A dryer ate dollar bills like a slot machine.

Eddie’s numbers showed $14,000 a month in coins. But without card readers or POS, the line between revenue and hope was thin. Maya wrote three words at the top of her pad: meters, leases, lifespan. Then she added a fourth: subscriptions.

[TRANSITION: Clipboard pages flip. A pen underlines “Seller Financing.”]

## Scene 3: The Bridge Deal — Afternoon
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Negotiation, seller financing structure

[VISUAL: Small office. Eddie across the desk. Contract drafts.]
[GRAPHIC: “$20K down • $1,400/mo × 60 months • 6% note”]

Eddie wanted out without fire‑sale prices. Maya needed a bridge without drowning in debt. The deal they built was a handshake translated into paper: $20,000 down. $1,400 a month for five years at six percent. Sixty‑day grace period to fix the worst leaks. Eddie would spend Saturdays answering legacy questions, paid hourly.

Luis stared at the amortization schedule and saw the rest of his thirties. Maya saw the part of the spreadsheet labeled “MRR.” She wasn’t buying machines. She was buying time.

They signed. The keys were cold and heavy like honest work.

[TRANSITION: Key turns. The neon flickers from half to full.]

## Scene 4: The Hurricane Made of Lint — First 60 Days
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Failures, reviews, stress on the marriage

[VISUAL: Handwritten “OUT OF ORDER” on five washers. Yelp review on phone: “Bring a book.”]
[GRAPHIC: “Cash Short: −$120” / “Utilities Spike: +$240 after midnight”]

The first sixty days were a hurricane made of lint. Bearings screamed. Dryers jammed. Yelp said “avoid unless you like waiting.” Coins didn’t add up—some nights the drawer was short by $120. Utilities spiked after midnight when the doors were locked.

Luis tightened bolts and cursed quietly. Maya apologized to customers she didn’t break, took notes, and made refunds from a tin she labeled “Goodwill.” The business was stealing quarters. The stress was stealing time.

Saturday rain turned Saturdays into nothing. Monday sunshine did nothing for Sunday’s damage. On day 47, a main washer died mid‑cycle with a toddler staring at it like a TV. Luis unplugged it, opened the panel, and closed his eyes.

That night, they argued in whispers. Not about love—about numbers. “We used our wedding money for this,” Luis said, staring at the ledger. Maya looked at the jar—now a vase with a single pen.

[TRANSITION: Pen taps a blank page. The word “SUBSCRIPTIONS” appears in block letters.]

## Scene 5: Stop Selling Cycles. Sell Clean Clothes. — Late Night
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Pivot plan, subscription tiers, SOPs

[VISUAL: Whiteboard with three plans. Lockers drawn in marker.]
[GRAPHIC: Tiers: $59 Light • $89 Family • $129 Power (pause anytime)]

Maya drew three plans with names people could remember: Light Load at $59, Family Flow at $89, Power Wash at $129. Not contracts—promises. Pause anytime. Pickup Tuesdays and Fridays. “We don’t sell access to machines,” she said. “We sell time back.”

Luis worried about lockers. Maya worried about volatility. She wrote recipes for reliability: SOPs. Bag tag. Weigh in. Wash at cold unless noted. Fold to template. Snap photo. Text on delivery. Quality isn’t a hope. It’s a checklist.

They retrofitted card readers on half the machines and added a small POS. Coins would still clink, but names would pay the rent.

[TRANSITION: QR code flyer taped to the counter. A customer scans.]

## Scene 6: Nadia’s Building — Month Three
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: B2B pilot, route density, locker install

[VISUAL: Apartment mailroom with fresh lockers labeled A–Z.]
[GRAPHIC: Route map tightening from scattered dots to clusters]

The first ten signups came from the counter flyer. The next thirty came from Maya’s hotel network. Then Nadia, a property manager, asked the question that changes math: “What about my building?” One hundred twenty units. A locker room near the mailboxes. A test.

Luis said, “We can’t afford lockers.” Maya said, “We can’t afford weather.” They negotiated a 60‑day pilot. Install the lockers at cost; revenue share on building referrals. Week one: twenty‑seven subscribers. Week three: forty‑five. The route went from scattered to dense. Fuel dropped. Time per stop fell under six minutes.

Now the laundromat stopped feeling like a slot machine and started feeling like a paycheck.

[TRANSITION: A van door slides shut. A route sheet shows fewer miles.]

## Scene 7: Roles, Rituals, and Relief — Month Six
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Marriage repair through process, metrics ritual

[VISUAL: Folding table with two notebooks: “Ops” and “Customers.”]
[GRAPHIC: Dashboard: churn ↓, pounds/bag ↑, utilities/revenue ↓]

They changed one more thing. Maya owned customers and quality. Luis owned machines and costs. Every Friday, they sat at the folding table with two pages: route density, churn, average pounds per bag, utility per revenue dollar. Talk first. Tinker later.

The argument that almost broke them became a meeting that kept them. Trust wasn’t a feeling. It was a calendar invite.

[TRANSITION: Calendar flips: Month 6 → Month 12.] 

---

## Scene 8: One Year Later — Montage
**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Visual Focus**: Scaled ops, staff, debt ahead of schedule

[VISUAL: Two attendants on shift; Maya greeting a subscriber; Luis replacing a bearing with a smile.]
[GRAPHIC: MRR: $18.9K • Total Revenue: $31K/mo • Subs: 420 • Margin: 24%]

One year in, FreshSpin did thirty‑one thousand a month. Four hundred twenty subscribers. Two attendants. Utilities stabilized. Debt ahead of schedule. Quarters still clinked, but most money came from names, not coins. The jar on the shelf held paper now: deposit slips and a printed vow renewal program.

They stood under a string of lights in front of row six and said the words they couldn’t afford last year. The party could wait. The life was already happening—warm, folded, and delivered.

## Lessons and CTA
**Duration**: 1 minute

Treat due diligence like a crime scene: meters, utilities, machine logs, coin integrity, and lease. Sell outcomes, not access: people don’t buy time on a washer; they buy time with their family. Build routes like chess: win the minutes you don’t drive. Protect the relationship that protects the business: roles, rituals, and a table where tough conversations happen before resentment does.
