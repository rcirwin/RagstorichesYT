# The Laundromat Love Story

## Episode Summary
Newlyweds Maya and Luis use their modest wedding fund to acquire a tired coin laundromat on a busy corridor. The stress of broken machines, cash leaks, and low foot traffic nearly breaks their marriage—until they pivot from coins to a wash-and-fold subscription with pickup and delivery. Recurring revenue stabilizes cash flow, pays down debt, and gives them their time—and relationship—back.
