## Video Title
They Spent Their Wedding Fund on a Broken Laundromat… Then This Saved Their Marriage

## Video Description
Most couples spend their wedding money on a party. Maya and Luis spent theirs on broken washing machines—and almost broke up in the process. Their turnaround came from one simple pivot: stop selling cycles, start selling clean clothes.

In this story, you’ll see how a wash-and-fold subscription, pickup and delivery routes, and a few tight SOPs turned a failing coin laundromat into predictable monthly revenue that paid down debt—and gave them their time (and relationship) back.

What you’ll learn:
✅ How to do laundromat due diligence (utilities, machine logs, coin integrity, lease)
✅ Why subscriptions beat weather-dependent walk-ins
✅ Route density 101: cluster stops, win minutes, not miles
✅ Simple pricing tiers that customers actually understand
✅ The weekly rhythm that protects both profit and partnership
